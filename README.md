# Introduction
I ran into a problem that i have many different learning direction. I've been trying to combine it, organize daily but it's hard to focus on different types of information in short period of time. So, recently i came up with the idea of "Alternating weeks". I don't know, maybe this learning method(or something similar) already exists, but again it's just a corollary to my observation.
# Problems
- different types of information(it's a problem 'cause our brain is not suited to multitasking)
- optimal learning time streak for one of the learning directions
# Idea
> alternate the study of one of the learning directions  by week numbers
## Example:
1. We have 3 directions to learn: `backend development`, `3D modeling` and `music making`. We looking at current week number, choosing **"studying direct of the week"**, and focusing on this area all week long.
2. Next week we choosing another item from our directions and doing the same.
3. After the end of the list of our directions, we just starting from first and repeating one after another every time.

# Problem no. 2
> i DON'T want to get confused with weeks and forget what learning direction is going this week

So, i wrote [simple script](https://github.com/justTrueCodeWriter/alternating_weeks_calc/blob/main/alternating_weeks_calc.py) to do this automatically
